# What I Have Learnt
In doing this project, I have learnt how to use the correct html elements to give the desired effect as well as css.
I have also learnt to not be frustrated when the code is not running as it is obviously a mistake that has been made and so I 
try my possible best to cal down and figure it out. I think the most interesting thing I have learnt so far is how to use js to make reusable code.
This is done by creating a custom html element in js. This really helped with the project.
